00:27:21,699 --> 00:27:22,675


353
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:23,525
-what ? even your station has been robbed ?

354
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:24,577
-yes man

355
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,827
Seth's shop jewellery had beeen robbed,

356
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:29,851
i had recovered that mall and kept in locker and i kept key with me

357
00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:33,977
when i wake up at morning and saw locker is locked like before

358
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:34,980
but inside there is no mall(loot)

359
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:37,703
i cant even understand what's happening ?

360
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:40,175
Sahadeva

361
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:42,046
in the same style in front of press meet

362
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,455
both of them are robbed

363
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:46,057
-how is that possible ? -even i cant understand that

364
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,081
even pressmeet knows everything about mall which we have recovered

365
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:51,236
after calling jewellery owners

366
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,738
we have to do mall identification and should submit to court

367
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:54,736
what shall i do now ?

368
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,439
if SP comes to know about this we will loose job

369
00:27:57,463 --> 00:27:58,983
also have to go for jail

370
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:00,432
to solve this case,

371
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:03,332
a very good officer required

372
00:28:03,356 --> 00:28:04,873
means,

373
00:28:04,897 --> 00:28:07,276
can we officially handle this case ?

374
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,300
submitting this case to private detective is better according to my opinion

375
00:28:11,301 --> 00:28:12,377
what you are telling is ok man,

376
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:14,683
if he has robbed our station itself

377
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:16,687
imagine how genius he would be  !

378
00:28:16,711 --> 00:28:19,711
to catch such guy,even our detective should be genius

379
00:28:20,111 --> 00:28:22,436
along with that he should be trustworthy too

380
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,126
for that

381
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,150
in my station there is one genuis

382
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:39,115
hot ghee

383
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:41,874
if you swallow then throat will burn

384
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:44,898
if you throw then you will be caught

385
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:48,128
overall difficult to breath situation

386
00:28:48,152 --> 00:28:49,772
now you only have to do something Diwakara

387
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:52,625
we shall do something dont worry

388
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:54,823
i will myself solve this case

389
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:57,847
but, i have my own conditions

390
00:28:58,347 --> 00:29:00,060
what are those ?

391
00:29:00,084 --> 00:29:03,084
first one-from tommorow onwards i will come to station whenever i wish

392
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,900
no one should ask why and what

393
00:29:08,883 --> 00:29:10,196
ok

394
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,220
along with that i require a <i>jawa bike</i>

395
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,426
my conditions are not finished

396
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,876
one more major condition is remaining

397
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,837
whats that ?

398
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:22,774
anyhow im in professional field

399
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:23,827
you should make some report

400
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:26,851
showing my unefficiency or may be women harrasment or rude behaviour

401
00:29:30,307 --> 00:29:32,533
and somehow you should write false negative reports

402
00:29:32,557 --> 00:29:35,184
should provide a report to department

403
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:38,208
and should remove myself from this job

404
00:29:40,108 --> 00:29:42,126
are you even mad ?

405
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,947
everyone die for promotion and increment

406
00:29:44,971 --> 00:29:47,395
while you are telling to remove you from job

407
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,195
by writing negative report

408
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:50,645
what else should i do swami ?

409
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:52,894
dreamt of swimming in ocean

410
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:54,144
but my father Annappa,

411
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:57,093
pushed me into the well which has no water

412
00:29:57,117 --> 00:30:00,117
if my conditions are ok for you, then your deal is ok for me

413
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,496
alright your fate

414
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,987

416
00:30:38,008 --> 00:30:41,008
this is the heartwrenching story of Diwakar grandma

417
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:44,739
you are roaming without job like useless moron

418
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,116
what is the use of saving a guy like you ?

419
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,816
die there itself

420
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,564
grandma

421
00:30:52,588 --> 00:30:53,986
instead of saving,you are telling me to die and moving  !

422
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,584

423
00:30:55,608 --> 00:30:57,586

440
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:39,934
even im tired of screaming for asking help like you

441
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:42,935
sat silently without getting any idea to come up same like you

442
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:43,847
after hearing your screaming for help

443
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:46,453
i thought of making timepass so simply acted like helping you

444
00:31:46,477 --> 00:31:49,477

how can i find a way ? this is minimum 15 feet

450
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:10,386
not even a single creeper or rope is there to try and climb up

451
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,486

452

825
01:01:09,085 --> 01:01:12,220
-Kusuma !
-dont you think we both think in same way !

fish is like life for me and even for you  !

827
01:01:16,857 --> 01:01:19,857

828
01:01:20,698 --> 01:01:23,698
means... you have fallen in love with me !

829
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:25,175

-confirm right !

831
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,200
why late then ? if we go to register office just fifty rupees fees

832
01:01:30,928 --> 01:01:33,928
then bring two garlands, and one guy as proof from both sides

833
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,304
entire marriage will be finished in just half an hour !

834
01:01:36,328 --> 01:01:39,328

836
01:01:45,411 --> 01:01:48,411
i didnt even finished 1 min conveying my love but you have started even family !

837
01:01:50,728 --> 01:01:53,716
we should understand each other, we should share our feelings

838
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,203
do you think marriage is like kids play ?

839
01:01:55,227 --> 01:01:56,957
then what you think loving is kid's play ?

840
01:01:56,981 --> 01:01:59,357
how did you love without thinking anything ?

841
01:01:59,381 --> 01:02:02,381
are you thinking of playing since girl is beautiful ?

842
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:05,373
there is huge difference in taste between those mangoes grown in trees and

843
01:02:05,397 --> 01:02:08,397
to those which are hybrid grown by injecting chemicals

844
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,737
same way even this love is

845
01:02:10,761 --> 01:02:12,987
tip should grow into flower flower should grow into seed

846
01:02:13,011 --> 01:02:14,984
then seed should grow into fruit

847
01:02:15,008 --> 01:02:18,005
understood ?

848
01:02:18,029 --> 01:02:19,455
1 minute

849
01:02:19,479 --> 01:02:20,555
stand there !

850
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:23,579
i grown in mango farm

851
01:02:24,188 --> 01:02:26,166
even i know i seed changes into fruit

852
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:27,913
you had given a sum right ?

853
01:02:27,937 --> 01:02:28,847
i have solved

854
01:02:28,871 --> 01:02:31,595
if you give six then three remains at the end

855
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:34,619
if its four then remains two half of the given sttones will be remained at end

856
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:36,594
this is the trick right ?

857
01:02:36,618 --> 01:02:43,030
you have become brilliant after joining me

858
01:02:43,891 --> 01:02:46,891

859
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:50,420

860
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:08,220

if you want to understand wolf then be a goat

869
01:06:37,123 --> 01:06:40,123
if you want to understand a girl then become a play boy

870
01:06:40,367 --> 01:06:42,345
our Beechi (famous poet) used to say

871
01:06:42,369 --> 01:06:44,592
Stop that and tell me what you wanted to say

872
01:06:44,616 --> 01:06:47,616
ok then.. i think you are not handling case properly

873
01:06:49,371 --> 01:06:49,953
because,

874
01:06:49,977 --> 01:06:52,977
my opinion is we have to think like thief to catch a thief

875
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,076
you gobar

876
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:59,100
if i kick you i should clean my leg
and you are advising me to catch thief

877
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:02,850
there is an quote that no one is younger than me
no is elder than Shivasharanas

878
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,356
im not eligible to advise you

879
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,604
thought of telling you so i said

880
01:07:09,628 --> 01:07:11,605
rest is upto you

881
01:07:11,629 --> 01:07:12,853
i will go

882
01:07:12,877 --> 01:07:15,204

883
01:07:15,228 --> 01:07:18,228

884
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:21,312

1184
01:30:26,627 --> 01:30:29,627

first of all they have no house man !

1193
01:31:01,739 --> 01:31:04,739

1221
01:33:17,688 --> 01:33:20,688
they will come morning sometimes even night

1222
01:33:20,878 --> 01:33:23,878
i have enquired those who came when station was robbed at night

1223
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:27,131

the day robbery happened, she also visited station

1263
01:37:52,870 --> 01:37:55,870

-Sahadeva leave that gun

1285
01:40:22,589 --> 01:40:25,589
this is more than enough to play with them

1286
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:59,246
you are looking beautifull in this dress

1287
01:40:59,270 --> 01:41:01,546
you didnt even imagine that i will be here right ?

1288
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:03,146
why you are here ?

1289
01:41:03,170 --> 01:41:04,546
i came to give food

1290
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:05,425
where are they ?

1291
01:41:05,449 --> 01:41:07,425
why that much concern towards them ?

1292
01:41:07,449 --> 01:41:10,088
even i have same concern towards you

1293
01:41:10,112 --> 01:41:12,685
i wanted to enquire you

1294
01:41:12,709 --> 01:41:14,684
so i came to take you dragging

1295
01:41:14,708 --> 01:41:17,708
please will you come ?

1296
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:25,468
i thought you were Sadhvi B Saroja Devi

1297
01:41:25,492 --> 01:41:27,966
but you are dacoit Poolan Devi

1298
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:30,990
-i know everything
-what you know ?

1299
01:41:33,641 --> 01:41:36,314
Yashoda

1300
01:41:36,338 --> 01:41:38,095
Geetha

1301
01:41:38,119 --> 01:41:41,119
Mary Thomas

1302
01:41:42,267 --> 01:41:44,846
what are these ?

1303
01:41:44,870 --> 01:41:46,433
i think now you will get clarity

1304
01:41:46,457 --> 01:41:48,653
this handwriting is yours only

1305
01:41:48,677 --> 01:41:49,905
so what should i do ?

1306
01:41:49,929 --> 01:41:51,805
station was robbed by none other than you !

1307
01:41:51,829 --> 01:41:53,403
since you didnt get culprits,

1308
01:41:53,427 --> 01:41:55,707
are you trying to frame me into this ?

1309
01:41:55,731 --> 01:41:56,807
the day robbery happened,

1310
01:41:56,831 --> 01:41:59,831
you have given complaint to 3 stations in different names

1311
01:42:00,177 --> 01:42:01,156
why ?

1312
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:02,673
just because i have went to watch Dasara, you are

1313
01:42:02,697 --> 01:42:05,697
blaming me for stealing Ambari (God's monument)

1314
01:42:06,078 --> 01:42:08,697
what proof do you have to prive me as thief ?

1315
01:42:08,721 --> 01:42:11,443
even blind people have went for all 3 stations the same day

1316
01:42:11,467 --> 01:42:13,203
what is the link between me and that ?

1317
01:42:13,227 --> 01:42:15,005
without any link or relation you came there to give them food ah ?

1318
01:42:15,029 --> 01:42:17,004
is giving food for needy is crime ?

1319
01:42:17,028 --> 01:42:20,028
same like me, many bring in this city bring food for them

1320
01:42:21,578 --> 01:42:23,154
law requires proof

1321
01:42:23,178 --> 01:42:26,178
not your cooked up stories

1322
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:28,585
if you have guts,

1323
01:42:28,609 --> 01:42:29,837
prove me as thief

1324
01:42:29,861 --> 01:42:32,305
i will myself surrender in station

1325
01:42:32,329 --> 01:42:33,205
instead of that

1326
01:42:33,229 --> 01:42:36,229
if you try to swim without knowing it,
you will be drown

1327
01:42:37,482 --> 01:42:40,482
carefull !

1328
01:42:43,481 --> 01:42:46,481
according to law,
what she said is right

1329
01:42:46,957 --> 01:42:49,686
no case stands without evidence

1330
01:42:49,710 --> 01:42:52,710
for law, proof is more important than truth

1331
01:42:54,964 --> 01:42:56,186
what you were saying was right dad

1332
01:42:56,210 --> 01:42:59,210
we cant become detectives just by reading books and cinemas

1333
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:02,936
even though accused was in front of me i was helpless

1334
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,960
i cant do this dad

1335
01:43:06,458 --> 01:43:08,537
why you feel sad for that ?

1336
01:43:08,561 --> 01:43:11,561
these are all common in our job

1337
01:43:12,810 --> 01:43:15,810
only after burning, pot becomes stronger

1338
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:37,215
in my life, i never smoked a full cigerate

1339
01:43:37,239 --> 01:43:39,366
even after that, how my hands burnt that day ?

1340
01:43:39,390 --> 01:43:42,390
that also both me and Suneela

1341
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:05,776
means,

1342
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:08,345
did we lost our sense for 8 minutes that day ?

1343
01:44:08,369 --> 01:44:11,245
physically no one injected us drugs

1344
01:44:11,269 --> 01:44:13,596
still we lost our sense

1345
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:16,620
is there a chance of injection of drug or any other chemical in any other way ?

1346
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:20,333
what did i eat that day ?

1347
01:44:20,357 --> 01:44:23,357
what did i drink ?

1348
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
will it be in powder form ?

1349
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:35,170
whats this man ? my face has been powdered ?

1350
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,767
after all by sparkling powder,

1351
01:45:53,791 --> 01:45:56,791
you made me loose my sense !

1352
01:45:58,291 --> 01:46:00,244
for the shock treatment we give to him,

1353
01:46:00,268 --> 01:46:02,494
he should permenantly sleep in coma

1354
01:46:02,518 --> 01:46:05,245
why are showing this much anger towards me Boss ?

1355
01:46:05,269 --> 01:46:08,269
every happiness is a missed tragedy

1356
01:46:08,618 --> 01:46:09,294
in the same way,

1357
01:46:09,318 --> 01:46:12,318
every tragedy is missed happiness

1358
01:46:12,367 --> 01:46:15,367
isnt it ?

1359
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
robbed station and telling lies with me

1360
01:46:28,269 --> 01:46:29,917

1361
01:46:29,941 --> 01:46:32,941
somebody has given you the wrong information

01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:41,205
dosage is enough ? or you want more ?

1363
01:46:41,229 --> 01:46:43,453

01:46:43,477 --> 01:46:44,956

01:46:50,079 --> 01:46:52,175
-come this side

1371
01:47:01,870 --> 01:47:03,096
i will tell the truth boss,

1372
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:05,845
i didnt do station robbery

1373
01:47:05,869 --> 01:47:08,869
do you know what happened boss ?

1374
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:43,790
you sing well..

1375
01:47:43,814 --> 01:47:46,183
oh L Board sir ! what makes you come here ?

1376
01:47:46,207 --> 01:47:48,336
wanted to organise music concert of you

1377
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:51,360
music concert ah ? where sir ?

1378
01:47:51,859 --> 01:47:54,859
in central jail

1379
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:12,500
now you go.. go

1380
01:48:13,087 --> 01:48:16,087
by applying leave for duty, did you brought her to mountain ?

1381
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:21,876
while im struggling here with case and all,

1382
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:22,866
are you playing hide and seek with your Kidney ?

1383
01:48:22,890 --> 01:48:25,219
hey shut up dont speak nonsense

1384
01:48:25,243 --> 01:48:25,965
give it here

1385
01:48:25,989 --> 01:48:28,667
what makes you bring sweets ?

1386
01:48:28,691 --> 01:48:31,691
did you get any evidence ?

1387
01:48:32,591 --> 01:48:35,017
why evidence ? i have caught even culprits !

1388
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:38,041
what  !

1389
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:46,500
i cant believe that blind people have involved in it  !

1390
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:48,614
thats the tricky point in this case dad

1391
01:48:48,638 --> 01:48:51,364
no one will believe that they have robbed

1392
01:48:51,388 --> 01:48:53,764
in fact that case doesnt withstands in any courts

1393
01:48:53,788 --> 01:48:55,064
by taking this as advantage,

1394
01:48:55,088 --> 01:48:56,385
those have made this job by using them (blind people)

1395
01:48:56,409 --> 01:48:57,887
how is this possible after all ?

1396
01:48:57,911 --> 01:49:00,911
first,the information of mall in station was collected,

1397
01:49:01,287 --> 01:49:04,287
Kusuma used to go there with the intention of giving complaint

1398
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,406
sir marks card was lost,

1399
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:22,430
i have to give complaint

1400
01:49:23,176 --> 01:49:25,914
how many staffs are there,

1401
01:49:25,938 --> 01:49:28,314
what is there in which place,

1402
01:49:28,338 --> 01:49:31,338
recovered mall is kept in which locker,

1403
01:49:31,718 --> 01:49:34,066
like that she used to observe every things and matter

1404
01:49:34,090 --> 01:49:35,845
after that she returned to home,

1405
01:49:35,869 --> 01:49:38,094
upon a dress which has square shaped designs,

1406
01:49:38,118 --> 01:49:39,575
she used to stich Kavades(stones),

1407
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:42,599
and prepared a map of station

1408
01:49:43,397 --> 01:49:44,806
after that,

1409
01:49:44,830 --> 01:49:47,830
she used to train us for robbery using map contained kerchief

1410
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:13,013
means by making us to sleep
they used to rob in front of police itself ah ?

1411
01:52:13,037 --> 01:52:14,516
yes sir

1412
01:52:14,540 --> 01:52:17,540
she is very brilliant girl !

1413
01:52:18,145 --> 01:52:19,245
by the way..

1414
01:52:19,269 --> 01:52:22,269
just by this agarbatthi smell they used to sleep ah ? how is that ?

1415
01:52:23,668 --> 01:52:25,996
they were loosing their sense not through agarbatti smell dad,

1416
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:27,916
but because of a drug called "Devils Breath"

1417
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:29,162
Devils Breath ah ?

1418
01:52:29,186 --> 01:52:32,186
there is a plant called Datura in Columbia nation

1419
01:52:32,658 --> 01:52:34,886
with the seed which came from fruit of this plant,

1420
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:37,135
they extract a drug called "Devils Breath"

1421
01:52:37,159 --> 01:52:40,035
if we sprinkle this drug into any person

1422
01:52:40,059 --> 01:52:42,134
or even if someone breathes it

1423
01:52:42,158 --> 01:52:44,385
he will be stunned for eight minutes

1424
01:52:44,409 --> 01:52:47,139
he cant notice anything that happens around during that time

1425
01:52:47,163 --> 01:52:49,351
this Devils Breath drug was supplied to all of them,

1426
01:52:49,375 --> 01:52:52,375
in the form of powder through Sagani Pinto

1427
01:52:53,192 --> 01:52:55,965
alas this asshole  !

1428
01:52:55,989 --> 01:52:58,014
how did Pinto get this drug ?

1429
01:52:58,038 --> 01:52:59,716
it was supplied illegaly

1430
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:02,740
for all black magicians, i used to supply

1431
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:09,139
means did you get the lost mall ?

1432
01:53:09,163 --> 01:53:10,365
no dad

1433
01:53:10,389 --> 01:53:12,886
these Pinto gang had only postman job

1434
01:53:12,910 --> 01:53:15,834
there is a man behind all of them

1435
01:53:15,858 --> 01:53:18,104
is it ?
who is he ?

1436
01:53:28,628 --> 01:53:31,366
he is much closer to you

1437
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:33,865
you also have meeted him once i say !

1438
01:53:33,889 --> 01:53:36,598
-Gurupada do it
-no no no

1439
01:53:36,622 --> 01:53:38,096
i will say

1440
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:41,120
black magician Nanjappa

1441
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:57,197
hey you brother !

1442
01:53:57,221 --> 01:54:01,175
why you hurt yourselves by hitting me ?

1443
01:54:01,420 --> 01:54:08,012
even if you kill me i wont reveal the secret !

1444
01:54:08,470 --> 01:54:10,797
i have given words to my Boss

1445
01:54:10,821 --> 01:54:14,575
my secret will be burried along with me

1446
01:54:18,969 --> 01:54:20,415
this is were i have stuck dad

1447
01:54:20,439 --> 01:54:23,439
oh my god ! what kind of network they have ?

1448
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,840
only doubt is who is the Boss behind Moadi Nanjappa

1449
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:30,340
that is...robbery happened in police station

1450
01:54:30,868 --> 01:54:33,868
whatever plan Kusuma does,

1451
01:54:34,041 --> 01:54:36,245
my doubt is that there might be an Mastermind who knows

1452
01:54:36,269 --> 01:54:39,269
geography, biography of the station behind this plan

1453
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:45,740
who is such mastermind in our area ?

1454
01:54:46,797 --> 01:54:47,926
ha i understood !

1455
01:54:47,950 --> 01:54:50,950
-who ?
-Marakutuka  !

1456
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:55,216
correct dad ! he didnt flashed to me  !

1457
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:56,897
he was the only guy i had left

1458
01:54:56,921 --> 01:54:59,644
definitely ! he is the Boss of them

1459
01:54:59,668 --> 01:55:01,644
such small thing didnt flashed to me dad !

1460
01:55:01,668 --> 01:55:03,894
every culprit is in my surroundings itself

1461
01:55:03,918 --> 01:55:05,167
this is like,

1462
01:55:05,191 --> 01:55:08,191
asking address with police after stealing a car

1463
01:55:08,887 --> 01:55:10,163
what kind of police im  !

1464
01:55:10,187 --> 01:55:13,076
now every dot is connecting

1465
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:15,977
girl with beautiful pettycoat-Kusuma

1466
01:55:16,001 --> 01:55:18,976
eyes which never gets dream-Pinto

1467
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,000
black magician with mantras power-Moadi Nanjappa !

1468
01:55:22,747 --> 01:55:25,747
minister above him-Annappa !

1469
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:28,826
-which Annappa man ! -isnt it ?

1470
01:55:28,850 --> 01:55:31,583
-he is Marakutuka -yeah yeah sorry

1471
01:55:31,607 --> 01:55:33,383
now the thing is,

1472
01:55:33,407 --> 01:55:35,474
Kusuma gave the plan

1473
01:55:35,498 --> 01:55:38,224
Pinto gave Devils Breath powder

1474
01:55:38,248 --> 01:55:39,726
blind people did robbery

1475
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:42,750
Moady Nanjappa gave the robbed mall to head constable Annappa

1476
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:49,084
why are you dying to say Annappa it is Marakutuka

1477
01:55:49,108 --> 01:55:52,108
you are in illusion !

1478
01:55:55,069 --> 01:55:58,069
illusion ? ah ?

1479
01:55:59,497 --> 01:56:02,324
Kusuma and Annappa doesnt have any relation

1480
01:56:02,348 --> 01:56:04,576
still Kusuma comes to our house

1481
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:07,600
calls you father-in law heartfully

1482
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:16,900
Father in law ?

1483
01:56:20,449 --> 01:56:23,136
my father himself sprinkled Devils Breath upon me,

1484
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:26,160
makes me loose my sense

1485
01:56:26,257 --> 01:56:27,441
if he had seen then we would have finished ! carefull

1486
01:56:27,465 --> 01:56:30,465
-why you brought here ? - i will go

1487
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:36,417
why you always will be in illusion ?

1488
01:56:36,441 --> 01:56:37,565
go and see your work

1489
01:56:37,589 --> 01:56:38,665

1490
01:56:38,689 --> 01:56:41,689

1491
01:56:45,945 --> 01:56:48,945

no body is there im only the Kingpin

1502
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:32,478
for every child, his dad will be hero

1503
01:57:32,502 --> 01:57:34,476
why did you become villain dad ?

1504
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:36,723
i thought your Sathya Harishchandra(symbol of truth)

1505
01:57:36,747 --> 01:57:38,475
why did you do this kind of work ?

1506
01:57:38,499 --> 01:57:41,499
to save those truth and justice what Sathya Harishchandra believed

1507
01:57:42,001 --> 01:57:44,074
means ?

1508
01:57:44,098 --> 01:57:47,056
there was an institution named "Ashakirana"
for blind childrens in Iduvani

1509
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:50,080
even our Kusuma's sister was studying in that institution

1510
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:02,484
if you eat all of this, then i will buy you new clothes

1511
01:58:02,508 --> 01:58:04,034
-ok ah ? -sis !

1512
01:58:04,058 --> 01:58:07,058
i will stich you new clothes

1513
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:18,650
in that institution they used to teach them

1514
01:58:18,674 --> 01:58:21,674
to stich bell bottom pants and used to do marketing

1515
01:58:24,108 --> 01:58:26,484
since blind childrens were stiching the pants,

1516
01:58:26,508 --> 01:58:28,865
along with that because of that new design

1517
01:58:28,889 --> 01:58:31,889
that Brand becaome popular very soon

1518
01:58:32,338 --> 01:58:34,265
everyone come

1519
01:58:34,289 --> 01:58:37,289
these are attractive clothes of wonderful designs

1520
01:58:37,567 --> 01:58:40,567
prepared by blind children of "Ashakirana" institution

1521
01:58:40,837 --> 01:58:43,837
these are the bell bottom pants with low affordable prices and with best quality

1522
01:58:47,891 --> 01:58:50,891
just when their life was coming to correct track,

1523
01:58:52,087 --> 01:58:53,686
Chamanlal Shet's interest raised upon the land

1524
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:56,710
in which "Ashakiran" institution was there

1525
01:59:00,561 --> 01:59:03,074
sir that land is very nearer to city

1526
01:59:03,098 --> 01:59:06,075
if we build a cinema talkies there,

1527
01:59:06,099 --> 01:59:09,099
we can earn as much as we want

1528
01:59:12,331 --> 01:59:13,917
that Shet with the help of inspectors,

1529
01:59:13,941 --> 01:59:16,256
planned to grab that land

1530
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:19,280
i have plan for that

1531
01:59:20,179 --> 01:59:21,357
see children

1532
01:59:21,381 --> 01:59:23,553
donars have come forward to break this old building

1533
01:59:23,577 --> 01:59:25,557
and to build a new one

1534
01:59:25,581 --> 01:59:28,057
so we shall evacuate this place for some days

1535
01:59:28,081 --> 01:59:29,833
we have to stay in some other place

1536
01:59:29,857 --> 01:59:32,857
by telling lie, they made all those children shelterless

1537
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:57,200
left them in a strange place at night

1538
01:59:57,278 --> 01:59:58,406
after that

1539
01:59:58,430 --> 02:00:01,430
they created a fake record that there were no children at that place

1540
02:00:01,530 --> 02:00:04,530
to grab that land was their plan

1541
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:13,333
no sir,

1542
02:00:13,357 --> 02:00:16,087
can leave children here and go ?

1543
02:00:16,111 --> 02:00:17,088
forest sir also dark night

1544
02:00:17,112 --> 02:00:20,112
they are children sir

1545
02:00:21,911 --> 02:00:24,911
there is no child of adult age otherwise we could grabbed them

1546
02:00:26,912 --> 02:00:29,912
climb up man

1547
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:57,786
by loosing the institution which was support for their life

1548
02:00:57,810 --> 02:01:00,536
they lost their mates and also thrown into streets

1549
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:02,282
for personal reasons and money

1550
02:01:02,306 --> 02:01:04,453
for making damage to many people's lives

1551
02:01:04,477 --> 02:01:06,177
upon those inspectors,

1552
02:01:06,201 --> 02:01:07,926
to take revenge

1553
02:01:07,950 --> 02:01:10,425

1554
02:01:10,449 --> 02:01:11,976
